       iptables [-t table] -D chain rulenum

       iptables [-t table] -S [chain [rulenum]]

       iptables [-t table] {-F|-L|-Z} [chain [rulenum]] [options...]

       iptables [-t table] -N chain

       iptables [-t table] -X [chain]

       iptables [-t table] -P chain target

       iptables [-t table] -E old-chain-name new-chain-name

       rule-specification = [matches...] [target]

       match = -m matchname [per-match-options]

       target = -j targetname [per-target-options]

DESCRIPTION
       Iptables  and  ip6tables  are  used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 and IPv6 packet filter
       rules in the Linux kernel.  Several different tables may be defined.  Each table contains a number of built-in
       chains and may also contain user-defined chains.

       Each  chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.  Each rule specifies what to do with a packet
       that matches.  This is called a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.

View all defined rules of iptables:
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 14894 packets, 1181K bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 14 packets, 1568 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
